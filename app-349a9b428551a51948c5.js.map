PostgreSQL version 11. Some notes:\n    - Text in double-dollar-strings is _always_ interpreted as some programming code. Text\n      in ordinary quotes is _never_ interpreted that way and highlighted just as a string.\n    - There are quite a bit \"special cases\". That's because many keywords are not strictly\n      they are keywords in some contexts and ordinary identifiers in others. Only some\n      of such cases are handled; you still can get some of your identifiers highlighted\n      wrong way.\n    - Function names deliberately are not highlighted. There is no way to tell function\n      call from other constructs, hence we can't highlight _all_ function names. And\n      some names highlighted while others not looks ugly.\n*/\nfunction pgsql(hljs) {\n  var COMMENT_MODE = hljs.COMMENT('--', '$');\n  var UNQUOTED_IDENT = '[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9$]*';\n  var

string is not validated to contain only valid D tokens\n *\n * - special token sequence rule is not strictly following D grammar (anything following #line\n *   up to the end of line is matched as

imports/exports?\n\n  This module is used to alias `create-react-context` package, but drop the the actual implementation part\n  because Gatsby requires version of react that has implementatoin baked in.\n  \n  Package source is using ES modules:\n    - https://github.com/jamiebuilds/create-react-context/blob/v0.3.0/src/index.js\n  \n  But to build this package `babel-plugin-add-module-exports` is used ( https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-add-module-exports).\n  Which result in both `module.exports` and `exports.default` being set to same thing.\n\n  We don't use that babel plugin so we only have `exports.default`.\n\n  This cause problems in various 3rd party react components that rely on `module.exports` being set.\n  See https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/23645 for example of it.\n  \n  Instead of adding same babel plugin we mimic output here. Adding babel plugin just for this would:\n   a) unnecesairly slow down compilation for all other files (if we just apply it everywhere)\n   b) or complicate babel-loader configuration with overwrite specifically for this file\n*/\nvar _require = require(\"react\"),\n    createContext = _require.createContext;\n\nmodule.exports = createContext;\nmodule.exports.default =
